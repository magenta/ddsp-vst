## Context ##
There are many possible permutations of machines, DAWs, and plugin builds, and we want to ensure that our plugin works on as many configurations as possible.
If the plugin runs successfully on your machine/DAW, feel free to submit a PR with an update to this file. If you experience a failure/crash, please file an issue on GitHub and add a link to it below.
